On this page please consult the book as we will be following this and for the next few weeks and for the most part some of the videos we will also consort to



CompTIA Security+ objectives covered in this chapter:
2.2 Given a scenario, use appropriate software tools to assess the
security posture of an organization.
• Command line tools (ping, netstat, tracert, arp,
ipconfig/ip/ifconfig)

I will show you how to install these tool s so you can start to play around with these tools in your own enviroments. We will walk trhough how to install a containerized version of linux on your personal machines and go through a breif walk through of some of these commands.

3.2 Given a scenario, implement secure network architecture concepts.
• Segregation/segmentation/isolation (Virtualization)

As an example we will virtulize a linux box on a windows machine(Process is different on mac machines). I will talk more in depth about what a virt is and how it is done in work place enviroments.

3.7 Summarize cloud and virtualization concepts.
• Hypervisor (Type I, Type II, Application cells/containers), VM
sprawl avoidance, VM escape protection, VDI/VDE

I will talk about hypervisors and how they are part of the virtualization infrstructure as a whole.

3.8 Explain how resiliency and automation strategies reduce risk.
• Non-persistence (Snapshots, Revert to known state, Rollback to
known configuration), Elasticity, Scalability

I will breifly chat about redundancy and resiliency are good practices that are used to automate these processes.


5.7 Compare and contrast various types of controls.
• Deterrent, Preventive, Detective, Corrective, Compensating,
Technical, Administrative, Physical

I will cover breifly more topics on types of controls used in the workplace 

6.1 Compare and contrast basic concepts of cryptography.
• Common use cases (Supporting confidentiality, Supporting
integrity, Supporting obfuscation, Supporting non-repudiation,

I will talk about basic crypto and data safety.
