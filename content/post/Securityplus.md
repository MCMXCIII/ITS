 # Welcome to the the IT study. 

This page is for the Security+ COMPTIA certification and every week I will be hosting a study session as well as compensation on the exam.

But this page will serve as a navigation for alot of the information pertaining to the exam from key concepts to specific details about the test.





# Welcome to the IT study session with Kaz.

For this study session I plan to have at least once a week.(Twice a week if time allows) This study will focus on the entry level certification the COMPTIA Security+ it is a base for many other certs and other on the job tasks you will need to be and be aware of. I am going to break down the few question people might have in a short little FAQ below and then touch on some more question at the end or possibly put them on another page.

## Why didn't you touch on these things?

***Why didn't you start with the A+?***
For the sake of brevity and helping those who want work in this field to go for a cert that will give them knowledge based on my time working in the field and what I have experience will come in good use while on the job. I will include some key parts of the A+ in this study session as the need arises but for the sake of getting a job as quickly as possible in my opinion the Security+ is one of the easiest ways to get a job in the DMV area due to the heavy government and contractor presence. Since the Sec+ is required by most agencies to even work on any of the machines it would be useful to have this before even trying to apply to any position.

***I don't have any books, or know where to get any of the training videos  how are we going to study?***

Relax. I will be hosting alot of the content needed to get started and to study with us. I will be hosting a download link to the book in pdf format. I will also be hosting alot of training videos as well. To help provide a structured format I will be releasing the videos as we approach each section and work through things together. I will most likely release them 2 times a week and we will review during our session on Saturdays. I will also be hosting a practice exam section where I will host/screen share practice questions and then we go through the questions together.

***What time is the study sessions?***
I am shooting for every Saturday at 8pm EST each session will be around 1 hour to 90 minutes long. If anything changes I will let people know as much in advanced as possible.

***Are you only doing Security+?***
At the moment yes. I have other certs in the works but for right now I will be focusing on Sec+ because of the area this groups is based in (The DMV area) and this cert is crucial to obtaining a job in this field especially in this area.

***What other certs do you have planned?***
I will focus on another cert after my time table has been completed(see the time table FAQ) for cert I do a study session for. After that time table a new time table will begin and I will move on to the next cert. Generally I would push everyone to focus on taking the test by a certain time(the end of the time table.) and then focus on another cert(because Ideally you would have passed the exam and are ready for the next cert in line)

The currently certs planned are:
Security+ (Time Table 1)
Network+(Time Table 1/2)
Linux+ (Time Table 3)
LFCE System Administrator(Time Table 4)
LFCE System Engineer(TBD)
RHCSA(TBD)
RHCSE(TBD)

In this order.
